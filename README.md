# GoFood
Go Food This project is a Python full stack framework, created in Django. Go Food is extremely adaptable, allowing employees of the restaurant to quickly change the site content, particularly the menu, using a very user-friendly graphical interface. Once registered, visitors to the site may simply explore this menu, add food items to their order, and designate delivery choices with just a few clicks, substantially simplifying the ordering process. Orders placed in the restaurant are quickly recovered and displayed in an easily understandable manner for efficient processing. 
Go Food is a platform where customers may purchase food online from a computer or a mobile device. Go Food offers a user-friendly platform so that even those who are technologically behind may order the food which can be enjoyed at home.
With the help of the system, customers may look at, browse and order the meals they like with the simple press of a button. The customer has the option to adjust the food's quantity and add other items to their cart if they so choose. When the food is delivered to the customer's door, they can pay with an electronic wallet or with cash. So even if someone doesn't have an e-wallet, they can still order the food and pay with cash later.
